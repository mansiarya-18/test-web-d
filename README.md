# test-web-d
In this project, I created an Environment Awareness webpage using only HTML. I used the basic HTML boilerplate tags (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>). 
For structure, I added headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>) and paragraphs (<p>). I used text formatting tags like <b>, <i>, <u>, and <del>. To separate sections, I included <hr> and <br>. The webpage also contains images (<img>) with alt, width, and height attributes, and links (<a>) for external resources. I used lists (<ol>, <ul>, <li>) with different types and values, and created a table (<table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>) to compare environment types. The background color was added using the bgcolor attribute in the <body> tag.
